# virtual-file-system
A Virtual File System implemented with C++ containers. The user can create/delete/move folders and files, among other operations described below. The filesystem is organized as a Tree. Each inode contains metadata about the node (e.g., file or folder, size, date). A folder can have zero or many folders and files, while a file is considered as a leaf node only. Deleting a file puts the inodeâ€™s element in a limited size queue (the Bin/Trash) which can be emptied manually or automatically. The interface allows a user to navigate and perform the described tasks below. At the beginning and end of the session, the file system is loaded, and dumped to the disk, respectively.
